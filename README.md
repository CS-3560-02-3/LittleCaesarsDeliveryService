ABOUT THE LITTLE CAESARS DELIVERY SUBSYSTEM
---
As gas prices continue to soar and the amount of people leaving the comforts of their homes start to dwindle, most restaurant companies begin to lose business. 

To counteract this issue, a new implementation was created in order to solve this dilemma. 
The concept of ordering food online and having it delivered to a recipientâ€™s front door could potentially increase sales and production. 

This is where the creation of Little Caesars Delivery Subsystem comes into effect. 
The subsystem aims to create a simple user interface where customers can select the food they want to purchase and assign drivers to their orders so customers can efficiently receive their food in a timely manner. 
The system relies on JavaFX as the view layer, Java as the domain layer, and MySql as the data access layer. 
As all three work together in a multilayer design system, it effectively reaches a solution for both customers and restaurants.
